# Mobile Assignment

## ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Mobile Assignment
SpaceX mobile app for Quanti recruitment process. This is an educational (non-production) application inspired by rocket theme.

### Assignment
The goal is to create an app that displays a list of all SpaceX rockets. The app will have a total of 3 screens. 

1. List of all rockets
2. Rocket detail
3. Flight Simulator

 * The application is connected to the [SpaceX API](https://docs.spacexdata.com). 
 * The graphics are in this repository
 * As for dependencies, use the ones that make sense to you, there is no other limit
 * It shouldn't take more than a week to develop
 * Commit continuously to your fork from this repository
 * Use FRP principles if you can 

#### List of all rockets
This screen is fairly clear from the graphic design 

#### Rocket detail
Oh, and this one too :) 

#### Flight Simulator
Here's a bit more tricky. There is a need to implement the gyro/accelerometer device. If the phone is lying down, the rocket is ready to launch. If it is lifted or tilted the rocket will take off and fly through the phone's display. 

### Submission
Create a fork of this repository and then give us access to it when you are done.
